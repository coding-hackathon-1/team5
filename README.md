#### Morning session:

Candle Passing
- We went through each and everyones personal and team goals.
  - We concluded that we agree to work as a team, divide work up evenly, and focus on each of our strengths instead of weaknesses

Brainstorming Session
- All of us talked about our personal experiences and brainstormed on things we struggled with.
  - We concluded that these were the main problems:
    - Budgeting
    - Housing
    - Socializing
    
Draft idea
- We came up with an idea of a personal finances application that asks a user's monthly income and recommends a set percentage to set aside for rent, food, travel, and miscellaneous expensiture. We also thought about recommending places to live and get food depending on their budget. It would solve the issue of housing by integrating the main filter of budget.

#### Afternoon session:

Personal reflection
- Upon reflecting from in-class feedback - we decided to go against our personal finances application because it does not solve a need to the extent which we were expecting. It was not the main problem that many of our colleages mentioned.

Personal experiences
- We went through a deep understanding of each and every of our experience as an incoming student from 1-month prior up until 1-month into freshmen year.
- We learned that budget was indeed not a main problem and most of us did not have that as our number one problem.
- We concluded the following the main problem:
  - Home-sickness
  - Sense of belonging
  - Sense of community
  - Socializing
- We decided to resurrect the Hult Cohorts project initiated by the HSA and implemented by the Administration last year.

Primary research
- We found out that the Hult Cohorts project was not successful due to management inefficiencies. 
- Cohort leaders were not balanced in terms of duties thus cohorts not performing as predicted.
- The point system implemented was inefficient because it involved unnecessary information like GPA.

Final idea
- Our final idea is a mobile application that incoming students can sign into to create an account of their personal information, nationality and languages spoken. The application will randomize a cohort and assign it to the user. The application will allow users to answer trivia questions to increase personal experience points that adds into the cumulative cohort experience points. 
- The objective is to remove pre-set clusters and allow students to meet people from different nationalities coming to Hult. It will encouage team work by incentivizing students to do activities for points that can be redeemed for prizes. This aligns with Hult's values of trying to promote a diverse environment in which studencts can learn about the world while being under the same roof.

#### Evening session:

Python coding
- Kept coding the main dashboard of the app

SQLite
- Downloaded and started to learn SQLite

Secondary research
- Researched problems for incoming students in general
- Reserached the pros and cons of cohorts and how it works successfully in other universities

User journey
- Mapped out the first stages of user journey to see how the application will flow

#### Morning session:

Python coding
- We started a base code for our register/log in function.
  - We fixed errors in the DataFrame and was able to export it to Excel
  - We fixed bugs from not being able to append information when having a function in a function
  - We tried fixing an error with local and global variables but was not able to
- We started a base code for our trivia questions

Brainstorming session
- Mapped our user journey to understand if users will have a smooth transition in usability from start to finish
- Created several to-do lists to make sure we tackle each problem we have and bug we need to fix.

SQLite
- Two members of the team downloaded SQLite and started learning how to use it 
  - We decided to go with this software because it was free and supposedly the easiest to learn

#### Afternoon session:

Python coding
- Finishing up trivia questions and creating a points system with each user

SQLite
- Still figuring out how to import a CSV file into the software to start doing data analysis
  - Figured out the import a CSV file by having our Python code natively create a CSV file. Changed primary key on SQLlite by adding a "user_id" above the indexes.

Google slides
- Created the base presentation and started to put title slides

Github
- Uploading documents that were not uploaded
- Created patches for some Python code uploaded on Github to make sure the code works
- Updated respository journal

ERD
- We created our ERD for Phase 1 and reflected with our work to make sure we have all the most valuable parts.
- We started to create the Phase 2 version

Candle passing
- We talked about our progress and if we are happy with what we have.
- We still have some things to figure out including wire frame, presentation deck, and SQLite

#### Evening session:

Python coding
- Finished up coding personal_xp and cohort_xp to make it run smoothly and update on respective data frames. 

ERD
- Finished Phase 1 ERD on Lucidcharts

Google slides
- Updated the slides 80% in to finish up in school

SQLite
- Figued our how to update databases on SQLlite to do further data analysis

Team bonding
- Conversed with Ayelet where she told us to work hard, but also take a break and have fun
- We ordered food and watched 30 minutes of a movie
